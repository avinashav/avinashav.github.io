# letsride-online-cab-booking-portal
LetsRide - An online cab booking portal built using HTML , CSS , Javascript and PHP + My-SQL (backend)
The Project was developed for presentation as 6th semester Lab-Project. 
To Run the project, we need to Install Xampp Software for running Apache server and My-SQL for database.

Database has a table "accounts" which keep tracks of registered users.
To use the website services one should have valid username and password (should register to get one).

HOW TO RUN :
Step 1: copy all files to "c:/xampp/htdocs/" location.

Step 2: Run XAMPP software, then start Apache and mysql servers.

Step 3: in phpmyadmin create a database called "test1" and then a table "accounts" with 'uname' and 'pass' as table entity, uname (primary-key) and pass should be varchar.

Step 4: in browser address bar type "localhost" and choose the file.
